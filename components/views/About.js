  <p>The goal of our company is to allow every user to give their physicians a performance rating. Users will be able to rate their doctors in 7 different areas, while also leaving a detailed review. This will allow other users of the site to be able to look up reviews on other physicians, and have a better foundation of knowledge as they meet and work with them. </p>
