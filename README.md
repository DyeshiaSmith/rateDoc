## About:
Ive created a web application for people who would like to conduct research on
doctors before they go. Once a user logs into their profile They will be able to
search for doctors, view the doctors name and location. Users can view ratings in
the categories of timeliness, environment, caring, and would they recommend. Users
will be able to leave a detailed review about their experience
This type of resource is vital at a time like this...
