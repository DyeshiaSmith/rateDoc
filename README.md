# Savvy Coders Project Boilerplate Starter Kit

## Overview

This template repository contains several opinionated, 'starter' files and settings to help Savvy Coder students focus more time and energy on learning how to code and/or craft 'business logic' for projects and less time on configurations.

In addition to a '.gitignore' and some VS Code specific extensions and settings, it includes the 'recommended' settings for:

1. [ESLint](eslint.org)
2. [Stylelint](stylelint.io)
3. [Prettier](prettier.io)

## Get Started

**First and foremost,** make sure that your local machine is set up with all of the 'dev environment tooling' as per [this guide...](https://www.notion.so/codefinity/Setting-up-a-Local-Dev-Environment-97de62a546f943fbbc7a246b4785a343)

Well, after establishing your directory structure on your local machine, (e.g. '~/Code/SavvyCoders'), kindly [follow these girections](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) - essentially, there should be a button üëÜüèæthat says **Use this template.**

Once this repo has been created on your GitHub, you can click on the button to 'clone' it as usual. Once it's `clone`d to your local machine, kindly `cd` into the directory and **be sure to do:** `npm i` to get all of the goodies. If you see any _errors_ (warnings are üôÜüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) on Windows, you may have to do `npm install`.

Now, enter `code .` to open this project in VS Code, and look for a prompt to 'install some extensions' once inside VS Code (in the bottom right of your screen). You should install these. üëçüèæ

Update this README and make any other initial changes or üå± files, etc. Go ahead and do your usual `git` steps, etc. etc. etc.

**Note:** This is a template repository, no need to 'fork it.

## About:
Ive created a web application for people who would like to conduct research on
doctors before they go. Once a user logs into their profile They will be able to
search for doctors, view the doctors name and location. Users can view ratings in
the categories of timeliness, environment, caring, and would they recommend. Users
will be able to leave a detailed review about their experience
This type of resource is vital at a time like this...
